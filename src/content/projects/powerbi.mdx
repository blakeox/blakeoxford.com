### Background

To enhance operational oversight and documentation compliance, I built a comprehensive system on **Microsoft Fabric**, leveraging **Power BI**, **SQL Server**, and Fabric-native dataflows. The platform delivered real-time dashboards and integrated AI-driven tooling for automated compliance auditing, significantly elevating clinical and operational transparency.

### Key Achievements

- **Full-Fabric Architecture:** Orchestrated a multi-tiered data strategy using **SQL Server**, **OneLake**, **Dataflows Gen2**, and **Power BI**, enabling seamless data movement, transformation, and visualization within Microsoft Fabric.
- **Role-Based Operational Dashboards:** Delivered real-time, personalized dashboards for clinicians, billing staff, and executives—monitoring metrics like patient volume, missed appointments, claim submissions, and resource utilization.
- **Automated Compliance Auditing:** Applied **cosine similarity algorithms** and **text embeddings** to analyze clinical note patterns, flagging copy-paste risks and improving audit outcomes.
- **HIPAA-Compliant Data Governance:** Implemented row-level security and Fabric’s built-in access controls to protect PHI and ensure regulatory compliance across all report layers.
- **Low-Maintenance Insights Pipeline:** Integrated data sources including **AdvancedMD** and internal systems into a self-healing pipeline with auto-refresh, drastically reducing manual intervention.
- **AI & Predictive Readiness:** Laid the groundwork for future machine learning capabilities, such as forecasting staffing needs, identifying at-risk patients, and modeling revenue leakage.

### Impact

By moving beyond siloed analytics into a unified Microsoft Fabric environment, this system allowed The Oxford Center to operate with unmatched agility and foresight. Compliance audits improved through automated similarity detection, staff had real-time access to relevant metrics, and leadership gained a holistic view of operations. The modular, scalable architecture supports continued evolution into AI-assisted decision-making.
