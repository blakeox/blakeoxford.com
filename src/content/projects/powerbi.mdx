### Background

To elevate both operational transparency and compliance oversight, I developed an end-to-end **Power BI** system that delivered interactive, real-time dashboards to staff and leadership. Beyond traditional analytics, I introduced automated compliance checks that flagged potential documentation issues using natural language processing.

### Key Achievements

- **Multi-Layered Reporting:** Created role-specific dashboards across clinical, billing, and executive teams—tracking KPIs like utilization, missed appointments, claims submitted, and patient flow.
- **Advanced Compliance Monitoring:** Used matrix-based text embeddings and cosine similarity algorithms to compare daily clinical notes. This helped detect repetitive or copy-pasted documentation, improving audit readiness and reducing fraud risk.
- **Automated Insights Pipeline:** Integrated SQL Server, AdvancedMD, and other sources into a streamlined, auto-refreshing data pipeline—ensuring reports remained accurate and timely with minimal manual effort.
- **Security & Privacy Controls:** Designed reports with strict row-level security to protect PHI while enabling HIPAA-compliant data access across teams.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built the foundation for future predictive insights, including modeling staff capacity, patient trends, and potential revenue leakage.

### Impact

This system empowered The Oxford Center to transition from reactive to proactive operations. Staff could access personalized data views in real time, managers spotted trends before they became issues, and compliance teams gained automated tooling to ensure documentation integrity. The NLP-based similarity scoring was especially impactful in audits, giving the organization a technical edge in quality assurance.
