### Background

FermentApp was born from the need to help home brewers and fermenters keep precise records and stay on top of critical process steps. Leveraging **SwiftUI** for a responsive interface and **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data sync, the app supports custom fermentation types—like kombucha, sauerkraut, and kimchi—and adapts its reminder schedule to each recipe’s requirements.

### Key Achievements

- **Dynamic Task Generation:** Built a to-do list feature that auto-schedules pH checks, temperature readings, and ingredient additions based on fermentation type and duration.
- **Interactive Timeline View:** Created a timeline component for users to log events (e.g., airlock activity, specific gravity readings, tasting notes) and review process history at a glance.
- **Real-Time Firebase Integration:** Structured Firestore collections for recipes, tutorials, and activity logs, enabling non-technical content updates via a web admin panel.
- **Clean, Engaging UI/UX:** Designed a dashboard and activity views in SwiftUI emphasizing readability, intuitive navigation, and clear status indicators.

### Impact

Since launch, FermentApp has helped users reduce batch failures and improve consistency by ensuring timely interventions and comprehensive record-keeping. The combination of automated reminders and detailed historical tracking has empowered hobbyists to refine their techniques and achieve better fermentation results.
