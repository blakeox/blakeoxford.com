### Background

To secure a $10 million loan for a new 36,000 sq. ft facility, I developed comprehensive financial models and bank projections. The goal was to present a clear and data-driven picture of the facility's financial viability, covering revenue forecasts, expense breakdowns, and cash flow projections.

### Key Achievements

- **In-depth Financial Analysis:** Performed detailed financial, market, and operational analyses to forecast revenues, expenses, and ROI over multiple scenarios.
- **Robust Modeling:** Built dynamic, spreadsheet-based models that incorporated sensitivity analysis and various market conditions, reinforcing our loan application.
- **Detailed Bank Projections:** Created projections that aligned with lender requirements, providing transparency and building confidence in the financial soundness of the project.
- **Strategic Loan Preparation:** Positioned the project for success by delivering compelling evidence of the facility’s cash flow generation and long-term financial stability.

### Impact

The accuracy and thoroughness of these models were critical in securing the $10 million loan, enabling the construction and successful launch of the 36,000 sq. ft facility. This work not only demonstrated financial feasibility but also laid a strong foundation for future growth and expansion.
