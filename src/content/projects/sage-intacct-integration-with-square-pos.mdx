## Background

To streamline financial operations and enhance accuracy, I led the integration of Sage Intacct with Square POS through the use of Shogo. This project was focused on automating the reconciliation process for accounting, providing real-time reporting and financial visibility.

## Key Achievements

- **ERP Integration:** Successfully implemented Sage Intacct and tied it to Square POS, creating a smooth data flow between sales transactions and accounting records.
- **Leveraged Shogo:** Utilized the Shogo platform to bridge the gap between disparate systems, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual intervention.
- **Custom Reporting:** Developed robust custom reports that reconcile transactional data, enhancing financial accuracy and simplifying audits.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Improved the speed and reliability of financial reporting, leading to faster month-end closures and more accurate financial statements.

## Impact

This integration not only streamlined the reconciliation process but also provided a reliable financial overview. By automating data transfers and report generation, the system minimized manual errors and empowered stakeholders with timely, actionable insights.
