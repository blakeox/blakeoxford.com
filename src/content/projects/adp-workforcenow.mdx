## Background

In an effort to modernize HR processes and financial integrations, I led the implementation of ADP Workforce Now. This project was designed to consolidate HR, recruitment, and GL integration efforts by connecting ADP with Sage Intacct—ensuring financial data consistency—while building an advanced HCM system. Additionally, the recruiting process was enhanced through integration with Indeed, and detailed operational insights were delivered via PowerBI reporting.

## Key Achievements

- **ADP Workforce Now Implementation:** Successfully deployed ADP Workforce Now to manage all HR functions in a centralized, streamlined system.
- **GL Integration with Sage Intacct:** Tied ADP Workforce Now into the general ledger of Sage Intacct, ensuring seamless financial reconciliation and accurate data flow.
- **Enhanced HCM Module:** Expanded HR capabilities by building out advanced HCM functionalities to support employee management and development.
- **Recruitment Integration with Indeed:** Integrated recruitment workflows with Indeed, automating job postings and candidate management for improved hiring efficiency.
- **Comprehensive Reporting via PowerBI:** Developed detailed dashboards and reports using PowerBI, providing stakeholders with real-time insights into HR and financial performance.

## Impact

This integrated solution not only centralized HR and recruiting processes but also created a reliable bridge between personnel management and accounting. The improved data synchronization reduced manual processes, minimized errors, and empowered leadership with actionable insights, thereby enhancing overall organizational effectiveness.
