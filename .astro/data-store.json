This initiative unified HR, recruiting, and general ledger processes by integrating ADP with Sage Intacct, ensuring consistent and accurate financial data flow. We enhanced our talent acquisition strategy through integration with Indeed, streamlining job postings and candidate tracking.\n\nWe also leveraged ADP’s standard and custom reporting capabilities to monitor payroll trends and assess staffing needs over time. Automation played a key role—portions of the open enrollment process and 401(k) payroll submissions were streamlined, reducing administrative burden and improving compliance.\n\nWhile we successfully deployed the core systems, the final phase—which would have provided even greater strategic value—was not completed. This involved integrating data from our Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, AdvancedMD, via an ODBC connector into a SQL database, and combining it with API outputs from ADP. The goal was to develop advanced productivity dashboards to evaluate departmental billing output against provider and technician hours, helping forecast staffing needs based on utilization metrics.\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- **ADP Workforce Now Implementation:** Deployed a centralized HCM system to manage HR functions efficiently.\n- **Sage Intacct Integration:** Achieved seamless general ledger synchronization between ADP and Sage Intacct.\n- **Advanced HCM Configuration:** Built out modules for employee management, payroll, benefits, and compliance.\n- **Indeed Recruiting Integration:** Enabled automated job postings and candidate funneling for streamlined hiring.\n- **PowerBI Reporting:** Developed real-time dashboards to visualize HR and payroll data across departments.\n- **Process Automation:** Automated open enrollment and 401(k) payroll submissions to reduce manual processing.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe project significantly improved operational efficiency by centralizing HR and finance processes, automating routine tasks, and enhancing data visibility. These improvements enabled faster decision-making, reduced errors, and provided leadership with insights to support workforce planning and financial forecasting.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### System Evaluation & Decision-Making\n\nWe began with Paycor, but after a year of use, it became clear it didn’t meet critical requirements—particularly the inability to separate managerial and time/attendance responsibilities. Non-scheduled employees like owners also had limited access to time tracking. We re-evaluated our options and conducted vendor comparisons. ADP emerged as the most cost-effective and reliable choice.\n\n### Stakeholder Alignment\n\nA project team was formed, including the Accounting Manager, HR Manager, CPA, IT Manager, and myself. We established project goals, scoped out requirements, and set deadlines.\n\n### Vendor Collaboration & Data Preparation\n\nWe coordinated closely with ADP’s implementation team to ensure all legacy data was prepared and transferred correctly.\n\n### Training & Go-Live Support\n\nDue to the aggressive January 1st go-live timeline and holiday staffing challenges, we conducted one-on-one onboarding for technicians and providers. IT staff, including myself, worked directly with employees to ensure successful adoption despite limited availability for group training.\n\n### Timeline Execution\n\nDespite the condensed schedule, we completed the core implementation in just two months—well ahead of ADP’s projected timeline. This was made possible by daily collaboration, fast decision-making, and close internal coordination.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Requirements Gathering is Crucial\n\nOur initial misstep with Paycor highlighted the importance of thoroughly documenting system requirements before entering a scoping phase.\n\n### Holiday Rollouts Require Cross-Team Support\n\nTraining during holiday periods proved difficult. In future rollouts, planning for broader involvement is essential to ensure smooth adoption.","src/content/projects/adp-workforcenow.mdx","51847a08e2419109","adp-workforcenow.mdx","powerbi",{"id":81,"data":83,"body":95,"filePath":96,"digest":97,"legacyId":98,"deferredRender":25},{"title":84,"description":85,"date":86,"image":87,"tags":88,"link":58},"Power BI Reporting & Compliance Intelligence System","Built a dynamic Power BI platform with operational dashboards and integrated compliance tools—leveraging advanced text similarity algorithms to detect documentation anomalies.",["Date","2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/powerbi-compliance-intelligence.png",[89,90,91,92,93,94],"Power BI","Data Analytics","Compliance","Natural Language Processing","Healthcare IT","Dashboard Development","### Background\n\nTo elevate both operational transparency and compliance oversight, I developed an end-to-end **Power BI** system that delivered interactive, real-time dashboards to staff and leadership. Beyond traditional analytics, I introduced automated compliance checks that flagged potential documentation issues using natural language processing.\n\n### Key Achievements\n\n- **Multi-Layered Reporting:** Created role-specific dashboards across clinical, billing, and executive teams—tracking KPIs like utilization, missed appointments, claims submitted, and patient flow.\n- **Advanced Compliance Monitoring:** Used matrix-based text embeddings and cosine similarity algorithms to compare daily clinical notes. This helped detect repetitive or copy-pasted documentation, improving audit readiness and reducing fraud risk.\n- **Automated Insights Pipeline:** Integrated SQL Server, AdvancedMD, and other sources into a streamlined, auto-refreshing data pipeline—ensuring reports remained accurate and timely with minimal manual effort.\n- **Security & Privacy Controls:** Designed reports with strict row-level security to protect PHI while enabling HIPAA-compliant data access across teams.\n- **Scalable Architecture:** Built the foundation for future predictive insights, including modeling staff capacity, patient trends, and potential revenue leakage.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis system empowered The Oxford Center to transition from reactive to proactive operations. Staff could access personalized data views in real time, managers spotted trends before they became issues, and compliance teams gained automated tooling to ensure documentation integrity. The NLP-based similarity scoring was especially impactful in audits, giving the organization a technical edge in quality assurance.\n\n[Explore more ↗]","src/content/projects/powerbi.mdx","c00420a83b881fbe","powerbi.mdx","ferment-app",{"id":99,"data":101,"body":113,"filePath":114,"digest":115,"legacyId":116,"deferredRender":25},{"title":102,"description":103,"date":104,"image":105,"tags":106,"link":58},"FermentApp: Fermentation Tracking & Task Scheduler","Designed and developed FermentApp, an iOS application to track fermentation processes, schedule essential tasks, and visualize historical data for optimal batch outcomes.",["Date","2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/fermentapp-icon.png",[107,108,109,110,111,112],"iOS Development","SwiftUI","Firebase Firestore","Fermentation","Task Scheduling","Data Visualization","### Background\n\nFermentApp was born from the need to help home brewers and fermenters keep precise records and stay on top of critical process steps.
