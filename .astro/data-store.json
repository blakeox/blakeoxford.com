This initiative unified HR, recruiting, and general ledger processes by integrating ADP with Sage Intacct, ensuring consistent and accurate financial data flow. We enhanced our talent acquisition strategy through integration with Indeed, streamlining job postings and candidate tracking.\n\nWe also leveraged ADP’s standard and custom reporting capabilities to monitor payroll trends and assess staffing needs over time. Automation played a key role—portions of the open enrollment process and 401(k) payroll submissions were streamlined, reducing administrative burden and improving compliance.\n\nWhile we successfully deployed the core systems, the final phase—which would have provided even greater strategic value—was not completed. This involved integrating data from our Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, AdvancedMD, via an ODBC connector into a SQL database, and combining it with API outputs from ADP. The goal was to develop advanced productivity dashboards to evaluate departmental billing output against provider and technician hours, helping forecast staffing needs based on utilization metrics.\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- **ADP Workforce Now Implementation:** Deployed a centralized HCM system to manage HR functions efficiently.\n- **Sage Intacct Integration:** Achieved seamless general ledger synchronization between ADP and Sage Intacct.\n- **Advanced HCM Configuration:** Built out modules for employee management, payroll, benefits, and compliance.\n- **Indeed Recruiting Integration:** Enabled automated job postings and candidate funneling for streamlined hiring.\n- **PowerBI Reporting:** Developed real-time dashboards to visualize HR and payroll data across departments.\n- **Process Automation:** Automated open enrollment and 401(k) payroll submissions to reduce manual processing.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe project significantly improved operational efficiency by centralizing HR and finance processes, automating routine tasks, and enhancing data visibility. These improvements enabled faster decision-making, reduced errors, and provided leadership with insights to support workforce planning and financial forecasting.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### System Evaluation & Decision-Making\n\nWe began with Paycor, but after a year of use, it became clear it didn’t meet critical requirements—particularly the inability to separate managerial and time/attendance responsibilities. Non-scheduled employees like owners also had limited access to time tracking. We re-evaluated our options and conducted vendor comparisons. ADP emerged as the most cost-effective and reliable choice.\n\n### Stakeholder Alignment\n\nA project team was formed, including the Accounting Manager, HR Manager, CPA, IT Manager, and myself. We established project goals, scoped out requirements, and set deadlines.\n\n### Vendor Collaboration & Data Preparation\n\nWe coordinated closely with ADP’s implementation team to ensure all legacy data was prepared and transferred correctly.\n\n### Training & Go-Live Support\n\nDue to the aggressive January 1st go-live timeline and holiday staffing challenges, we conducted one-on-one onboarding for technicians and providers. IT staff, including myself, worked directly with employees to ensure successful adoption despite limited availability for group training.\n\n### Timeline Execution\n\nDespite the condensed schedule, we completed the core implementation in just two months—well ahead of ADP’s projected timeline. This was made possible by daily collaboration, fast decision-making, and close internal coordination.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Requirements Gathering is Crucial\n\nOur initial misstep with Paycor highlighted the importance of thoroughly documenting system requirements before entering a scoping phase.\n\n### Holiday Rollouts Require Cross-Team Support\n\nTraining during holiday periods proved difficult. In future rollouts, planning for broader involvement is essential to ensure smooth adoption.","src/content/projects/adp-workforcenow.mdx","9a3a07deee3a648b","adp-workforcenow.mdx","llm-note-coaching",{"id":66,"data":68,"body":78,"filePath":79,"digest":80,"legacyId":81,"deferredRender":25},{"title":69,"description":70,"date":71,"image":72,"tags":73,"link":43},"OpenAI-Powered Documentation Quality Feedback System","Developed an end-to-end solution using the OpenAI API to ingest de-identified patient notes and generate actionable feedback—ensuring technicians and providers produce documentation that meets Blue Cross Blue Shield audit standards.",["Date","2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/openai-doc-quality.png",[74,40,41,39,75,76,77],"OpenAI","Blue Cross Blue Shield","Documentation Quality","Python","### Background\n\nTo further elevate clinical documentation and streamline compliance efforts, I architected a solution leveraging the OpenAI API to automatically review de-identified patient notes. By integrating with existing data pipelines, this system pulled encrypted, PHI-stripped records from our SQL Server repository, forwarded them to the OpenAI Playground with a custom prompt tailored to Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) audit criteria, and returned granular, role-based feedback. The result was a near real-time mechanism for technicians and providers to iteratively refine their notes—significantly reducing audit exceptions and rework.\n\n### Key Achievements\n\n- **Automated Note Ingestion & De-Identification:** Designed a secure ETL process using Python and SQL Server that extracted patient notes, applied deterministic de-identification routines (redacting names, dates, and identifiers), and staged content for API consumption—all within HIPAA-compliant guardrails.\n- **Custom BCBS Audit Prompt Engineering:** Collaborated with clinical auditors to craft a specialized prompt that instructed OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to evaluate each note against BCBS documentation guidelines, identifying missing elements (e.g., medical necessity language, precise CPT justification, signature line) and highlighting potential risk areas (e.g., ambiguous phrasing, unsupported treatment rationale).\n- **Role-Specific Feedback Generation:** Implemented logic to parse the model’s response and categorize feedback by audience type:\n  - **Technicians/Assistants:** Action items on capturing intervention details, including units of service and clinician credentials.\n  - **Providers/BCBAs:** Recommendations on enhancing clinical rationale, aligning treatment goals with evaluative criteria, and ensuring consistency with state therapy regulations.\n- **Integrated Review Dashboard:** Built a Power BI integration that consumed the OpenAI feedback JSON, rendering a column-level view of audit readiness metrics. Providers could filter by date range, note author, or patient cohort—making it trivial to identify systemic documentation gaps and monitor improvement over time.\n- **API-Driven Continuous Improvement:** Deployed a serverless function in Azure Functions that orchestrated nightly batch processing of new notes. If the model flagged more than 5 notes with critical omissions, the system automatically triggered an email alert to compliance leads, ensuring proactive remediation.\n\n### Impact\n\nBy embedding AI-driven review directly into our clinical workflow, we achieved:\n\n- **50% Reduction in Audit Exceptions:** Providers received immediate, contextual feedback, leading to more compliant notes on the first pass and lowering secondary review cycles.\n- **Consistent Audit Preparedness:** Technicians adopted a standardized documentation style guided by the AI’s recommendations—minimizing variability across therapists and sites.\n- **Resource Optimization:** Compliance teams reallocated 20 hours/week from manual note reviews to higher-value tasks (e.g., targeted training, process refinement).\n- **Scalable Architecture:** The modular design supports onboarding additional payers (e.g., Aetna, UnitedHealthcare) by swapping in new prompt templates—paving the way for multi-payer audit readiness.\n\nThis OpenAI-powered system transformed passive documentation checks into an active, data-driven coaching tool—ensuring our providers and technicians consistently meet BCBS requirements and drive better patient care.","src/content/projects/LLM-note-coaching.mdx","a805d66706b3ab5e","LLM-note-coaching.mdx","advancedmd-implementation",{"id":82,"data":84,"body":95,"filePath":96,"digest":97,"legacyId":98,"deferredRender":25},{"title":85,"description":86,"date":87,"image":88,"tags":89,"link":94},"AdvancedMD Implementation","Transitioned from paper records to a unified digital EHR system, integrating ABA, PT, OT, ST, and medical appointments with electronic billing.",["Date","2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/advancedmd-implementation.png",[90,91,92,93],"EHR","Digital Transformation","Automation","Healthcare","https://www.advancedmd.com/","### Background\n\nIn 2018, I led the implementation of **AdvancedMD**, a comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, to replace outdated paper-based workflows.
