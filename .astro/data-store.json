This initiative unified HR, recruiting, and general ledger processes by integrating ADP with Sage Intacct, ensuring consistent and accurate financial data flow. We enhanced our talent acquisition strategy through integration with Indeed, streamlining job postings and candidate tracking.\n\nWe also leveraged ADP’s standard and custom reporting capabilities to monitor payroll trends and assess staffing needs over time. Automation played a key role—portions of the open enrollment process and 401(k) payroll submissions were streamlined, reducing administrative burden and improving compliance.\n\nWhile we successfully deployed the core systems, the final phase—which would have provided even greater strategic value—was not completed. This involved integrating data from our Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, AdvancedMD, via an ODBC connector into a SQL database, and combining it with API outputs from ADP. The goal was to develop advanced productivity dashboards to evaluate departmental billing output against provider and technician hours, helping forecast staffing needs based on utilization metrics.\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- **ADP Workforce Now Implementation:** Deployed a centralized HCM system to manage HR functions efficiently.\n- **Sage Intacct Integration:** Achieved seamless general ledger synchronization between ADP and Sage Intacct.\n- **Advanced HCM Configuration:** Built out modules for employee management, payroll, benefits, and compliance.\n- **Indeed Recruiting Integration:** Enabled automated job postings and candidate funneling for streamlined hiring.\n- **PowerBI Reporting:** Developed real-time dashboards to visualize HR and payroll data across departments.\n- **Process Automation:** Automated open enrollment and 401(k) payroll submissions to reduce manual processing.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe project significantly improved operational efficiency by centralizing HR and finance processes, automating routine tasks, and enhancing data visibility. These improvements enabled faster decision-making, reduced errors, and provided leadership with insights to support workforce planning and financial forecasting.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### System Evaluation & Decision-Making\n\nWe began with Paycor, but after a year of use, it became clear it didn’t meet critical requirements—particularly the inability to separate managerial and time/attendance responsibilities. Non-scheduled employees like owners also had limited access to time tracking. We re-evaluated our options and conducted vendor comparisons. ADP emerged as the most cost-effective and reliable choice.\n\n### Stakeholder Alignment\n\nA project team was formed, including the Accounting Manager, HR Manager, CPA, IT Manager, and myself. We established project goals, scoped out requirements, and set deadlines.\n\n### Vendor Collaboration & Data Preparation\n\nWe coordinated closely with ADP’s implementation team to ensure all legacy data was prepared and transferred correctly.\n\n### Training & Go-Live Support\n\nDue to the aggressive January 1st go-live timeline and holiday staffing challenges, we conducted one-on-one onboarding for technicians and providers. IT staff, including myself, worked directly with employees to ensure successful adoption despite limited availability for group training.\n\n### Timeline Execution\n\nDespite the condensed schedule, we completed the core implementation in just two months—well ahead of ADP’s projected timeline. This was made possible by daily collaboration, fast decision-making, and close internal coordination.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Requirements Gathering is Crucial\n\nOur initial misstep with Paycor highlighted the importance of thoroughly documenting system requirements before entering a scoping phase.\n\n### Holiday Rollouts Require Cross-Team Support\n\nTraining during holiday periods proved difficult. In future rollouts, planning for broader involvement is essential to ensure smooth adoption.","src/content/projects/adp-workforcenow.mdx","51847a08e2419109","adp-workforcenow.mdx","powerbi",{"id":81,"data":83,"body":96,"filePath":97,"digest":98,"legacyId":99,"deferredRender":25},{"title":84,"description":85,"date":86,"image":87,"tags":88,"link":58},"Microsoft Fabric Reporting & Compliance Intelligence System","Architected a robust Microsoft Fabric solution combining Power BI, SQL-based pipelines, and NLP-driven compliance checks to transform documentation quality and operational visibility in healthcare.",["Date","2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"/assets/images/powerbi-compliance-intelligence.png",[89,90,91,92,93,94,95],"Microsoft Fabric","Power BI","Data Engineering","Compliance","Natural Language Processing","Healthcare IT","SQL Server","### Background\n\nTo enhance operational oversight and documentation compliance, I built a comprehensive system on **Microsoft Fabric**, leveraging **Power BI**, **SQL Server**, and Fabric-native dataflows.
